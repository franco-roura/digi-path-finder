# Digi Path Finder

This is a rudimentary remake of a tool for an old game done in 4~5 hours.
It has a [BFS algorithm](./src/lib/path-finder/README.md) and a bunch of images that I scraped from https://digidb.io.

The main difference with the original tool is a11y on mobile. Also, this version doesn't have a hard limit on the amount skills you can search for (It'll just take forever and warm up your cpu).
